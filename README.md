# mBaaS Demo App

![image](http://docs.feedhenry.com/static/themes/lnf1/img/plugins-mbaas-demo.jpg)

This application is used to demo the mBaaS integrations available with FeedHenry Cloud Plugins. This app is a collection of the code snippets used to test these integrations, along with a UI for testing.  
To use these integrations, environment variables to configure the integrations must be added. These are documented in the Plugins tab of the FeedHenry studio.
